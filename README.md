This projected is licensed under MIT. 
I opted to license my project under MIT since its short and very easy to understand. Also it gives maximum freedom to the user as it has very less constraints. It gives the user the luxury to do whatever changes he wants as long as it doesn't affect the publisher. Also the concept of open sourcing and making your work available for the community was really appealing.
